# Amazon-Web-scraper
This is an amazon web scraper in which products name, its price ,its detail and its image url are scraped. The scraper works for most of the web pages given in a csv file but there are some exceptions due to change in the structure of the website. This scraper uses selenium to scrape the data with the help of chrome web driver. The final output will be stored in an array of dictionary. The data which scraper is not able to scrape are given values None. At last the final output is stored in json file. The above code is working, you can just take it from here and run it in your local system where chromedriver should be in same working directory. I have not included the ouput.json file here as the code was taking long time to run as I have included implicit_wait() in the code just in order to rectify some unexpected errors if page take a bit longer to load.
